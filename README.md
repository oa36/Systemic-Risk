# Systemic-Risk
This is an initial version of a shiny dashboard that estimates systemic riks following a quantile regression approach as proposed by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011).
Next version will be more generalized, where anyone can upload their own data through the dashboard and estimate systemic risk.
